# Shorts On Mars
## A Mars Weather App

### React app using NASA's free Mars weather api to display weather conditions (temperature and wind) from the past 7 sols.

NOTE: The weather api is currently not being updated, consequently the app does not work. Clearly the error handling during fetch can be much improved.

### ToDo
- Further fetch improvements
- Higher DPR image optimization
- Shorts recommendation based on temperatures of past week
- Add options to change filter effect used and adjust values
